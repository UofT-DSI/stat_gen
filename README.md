## Description

This course provides students with the knowledge foundations necessary to conduct statistical analysis of genetic association study data. It features a series of lectures and hands-on coding sessions covering key topics, including fundamental concepts in population genetics, population structure in genetic association studies, quality control in genetic data and genome-wide association studies. The course places strong emphasis on the use of modern computational tools such as PLINK, MEGMA and GRAF-pop, and real-world data applications to preparing students for both academic and applied careers in statistical genetics and genetic epidemiology.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the module, participants will be able to:

**Week 1:**

* Understand basic molecular genetics concepts and common genetic models.
* Distinguish between Mendelian and complex trait inheritance.
* Understand the principles of population genetics, including allele frequencies, genetic drift, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.

**Week 2:**
* Understand key designs and statistical models used in genetic association studies, including case-control and regression-based approaches.
* Learn how to implement genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including key quality control steps and software tools.

## Assignments

Participants should review the [Assignment Submission Guide](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/onboarding_documents/submissions.md) for instructions on how to complete assignments in this module.

There are two assignments.

1. [Assignment 1](./02_activities/assignments/Assignment1.md)
1. [Assignment 2](./02_activities/assignments/Assignment2.md)

## Delivery of the Learning Module

This module will include live learning sessions and optional, asynchronous work periods. During live learning sessions, the Technical Facilitator will introduce and explain key concepts and demonstrate core skills. Learning is facilitated during this time. Before and after each live learning session, the instructional team will be available for questions related to the core concepts of the module. Optional work periods are to be used to seek help from peers, the Learning Support team, and to work through the assignments in the learning module, with access to live help. Content is not facilitated, but rather this time should be driven by participants. We encourage participants to come to these work periods with questions and problems to work through. 
 
Participants are encouraged to engage actively during the learning module. They key to developing the core skills in each learning module is through practice. The more participants engage in coding along with the instructional team, and applying the skills in each module, the more likely it is that these skills will solidify. 

Each session will consist of slides to introduce topics, live coding to demonstrate the topics, and occasional breakout rooms/live polls to reinforce the topics. The technical facilitator will introduce the concepts through a collaborative live coding session using R and other specialized genetic sofwares. The technical facilitator will upload any live coding files to this repository for participants to revisit under `./04_this_cohort/live_code`.

## Requirements

* Participants are not expected to have any coding experience; the learning content has been designed for beginners.
* Participants are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with others to enhance their learning experience.
* Participants must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
* Participants must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code in order to complete assignments. It should be used as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
* We expect Participants to have completed the instructions mentioned in the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/).
* We encourage participants to default to having their camera on at all times, and turning the camera off only as needed. This will greatly enhance the learning experience for all participants and provides real-time feedback for the instructional team.
